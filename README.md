This effort has been sparked by Dale's [presentation](http://portal.sliderocket.com/vmware/STIC-2012-Practical-Git-for-Smalltalk)
at STIC 2012 ([video](http://www.stic.st/conferences/stic12/stic12-abstracts/practical-git-for-smalltalk/)).

# Goals

The goal is to have a version controlled environment for cross-dialect projects. 
We do not aim to replace existing dialect solutions. There should be a convenient 
way to run development of a particular branch of a project in a dialect specific 
manner but be able to export the results into a (usually github based) common cross-dialect 
repository. The vision is that a cross-dialect project will maintain separate master 
branches for each dialect and rely on merging capabilities of the version control system to 
move changes between these branches.
